# Scroll-data-bot

This is a discord bot that tracks messages and user activity on the Scroll discord and puts the data on GBQ.

To use the bot, you must enter the appropriate command (e.g. '$update_members') on the bot_commands channel on the Scroll discord.

In future versions, this bot will do this automatically.
